<h2>Chemical Equations and Gaussian Elimination</h2>


This is a fun little thought experiment. Can we balance chemical equations
with linear algebra? Obviously yes. But can **I** do it, from scratch,
with no crutches for matrix operations like inversion and nullspace calculation?

</br></br>
<h4>What's a chemical equation?</h4>

This is a chemical equation:
<ul>
<li> You have some number of reactant molecules, each consisting of one or more 
  elements
<li> You also have some number of molecules that are products of the reaction
<li> Each molecule consists of some number of elements, each of which are present 
  in an arbitrary amount
</ul>
</br> </br>
One example of a chemical equation is burning meth. Methane combines with 
oxygen to yeild carbon dioxide and water:
</br> </br>

$$CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O$$

</br></br>
<h4>What is balancing an equation?</h4>

The law of conservation of mass dictates that the quantity of each element 
does not change as it goes through a reaction. Nothing can be gained or lost.
</br> </br>
In the description of the meth burning example we have an oxygen and hydrogen
imbalance: We see four H's and two O's among the reactants, and one H and three 
O's among the products. This is not good. We need some way of choosing how 
many of each molecule type we want to put into the reaction so that element 
quantities are preserved through the reaction. The balanced version of the 
meth burning equation is

$$    CH4 + 2(O2) -> CO2 + 2(H2O) = CH4 +  O4   -> CO2 +  H4O2$$

This is the task that this program accomplishes.
</pre></br></br>
<h4>So what's the scoop? How are you gonna do it?</h4>

Ok. Here's the fun part. There are well-known easy algorithms for balancing 
chemical equations that essentially cross-multiply molecules to align element 
frequencies, but I think my way is a little more fun.
</br> </br>
Begin with the observation that each molecule in an equation can be represented 
by a vector. Each attribute of this vector corresponds to the frequency of some 
element in its corresponding molecule. There is one attribute for each element 
that is involved in the entire reaction. For example:
<pre>
        CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O    
    C   [1]  [0]    [1]   [0]
    H   [4]  [0] -> [0]   [1]
    O   [0]  [2]    [2]   [1]
</pre>
The process of balancing equations involves assigning a multiple to each molecule 
that makes element frequencies equal to each other:
<pre>
        a(CH4) + b(O2) -> c(CO2) + d(H2O)
    C     [1]      [0]      [1]       [0]
    H   a [4]  + b [0]  = c [0]  +  d [1]
    O     [0]      [2]      [2]       [1]
</pre>
Linear combinations of vectors you say? Let's throw this stuff into some matrices.
<pre>
      [1 0]          [1 0]
      [4 0] [a]   =  [0 1] [c]
      [0 2] [b]      [2 1] [d]
</pre>
<pre>
      [1 0 1 0] [a]       [0]
      [4 0 0 1] [b]    =  [0]
      [0 2 2 1] [-c]      [0]
                [-d]      [0]
         A       x     =   0
</pre>
Systems of the form Ax = 0 are easy to solve. Any vector that is in the nullspace 
of A will do.
</br> </br>
This program finds an independant basis for nullspace(A) via gaussian elimination. 
It then takes each vector and converts it back to chemical equation form. Each 
resulting equation will be a balanced version of the input!

</br></br>
<h4>Code</h4>


The moment I'm sure you've all been waiting for. Yes I wasted my time coding 
this up, and yes it seems to work. Booyeah. 
</br> </br>
Here's the code:
<ul>
<li> <a href="balancer.py">balancer.py</a>: main program that does all the stuff.
<ul>
  <li> parse chemical equations into a matrix
  <li> decode the nullspace of that matrix
  <li> convert the nullspace back into chemical form
</ul>
<li> <a href="nullspace_calculator.py">nullspace_calculator.py</a>: utilities for nullspace calculation.
<ul>
  <li> there's a function to get a matrix in row reduced echelon form
  <li> there's another function that takes a matrix and spits back a basis for 
    that matrix's nullspace
</ul>
<li> <a href="matrix_utils.py">matrix_utils.py</a>: utilities for matrix operations, e.g.
<ul>
  <li> inserting rows, cols, etc
</ul>
<li> <a href="matrix_inverter.py">matrix_inverter.py</a>: utilities for inversion, e.g.
<ul>
  <li> calculating determinants
  <li> "true" inverse
  <li> left inverse
  <li> right inverse
  <li> methods that really belong in matrix_utils like toString and matrix multiplication
</ul>
</ul>
</br>
You can try it out with some sample inputs, like:

\begin{align}\notag
Al + Fe2O4 &\to Fe + Al2O3 \\
C5H12 + O2 &\to CO2 + H2O \\
Zn + HCl &\to + H2\\
Ca(OH)2 + H3PO4 &\to (PO4)2 + H2O\\
FeCl3 + NH4OH &\to (OH)3 + NH4Cl\\
K4[Fe(SCN)6] + K2Cr2O7 + H2SO4 &\to (SO4)3 + Cr2(SO4)3 + CO2 + H2O + K2SO4 + KNO3
\end{align}
