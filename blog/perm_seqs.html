<h2>Permutation Sequences</h2>


This is a nice little programming problem I've come across. It has 
a straightforward solution, but there's another way of looking at the 
problem that's pretty neat. The solution discussed here isn't without 
issues, but I think it's certainly a useful exercise in combinatorics. 

</br></br>
<h4>The Problem</h4>

The set $[1,2,3,â€¦,n]$ contains a total of $n!$ unique permutations.
</br> </br>
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, We get the
 following sequence (ie, for $n = 3$):
<pre>
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
</pre>
Given $n$ and $k$, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: The given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
</pre>


</br></br>
<h4>A Neat Solution</h4>

Let's start off by looking at an example. Let's look at the 4th element
in the sequence of permutations of [1,2,3]
<pre>
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1  **
3 1 2
3 2 1
</pre>

Well it's apparent that we're going to be selecting elements from an 
array $a = [1,2,3]$ to build each permutation. After we select an element,
it's done - the only other elements that remain valid for selection 
are the other elements in a. So we can delete each selected element from a.
</br> </br>
We can also think of each permuation in terms of each element's index in a.
</br> </br>
The above two observations/ideas can be combined. The permuation "1 2 3" 
becomes "0 0 0", because: - 1 is the 0th element of a$ = [1,2,3]$ - 2 is 
the 0th element of a = [2, 3] - 3 is the 0th element of $a$ = [3]
</br> </br>
Let's apply this translation to all of the ordered permuations of [1,2,3]:
<pre>
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 0
2 0 0 
2 1 0
</pre>
Now all we need to do is look up the right indices for permuation k and 
we're done! But how to do that...It's evident that we're going to be 
building these indices one element at a time. So for a permuation element 
i, how do we get the ith index?
</br> </br>
Well, it seems like in each column the indices are chunked up into "blocks" 
of repeated digits. The size of those blocks shrink from column to column. 
E.g. for column 1:
<pre>
0 0 0   block 0, block digit: 0
0 1 0

1 0 0   block 1, block digit: 1
1 1 0

2 0 0   block 2, block digit: 2 
2 1 0
</pre>
Note that the size of a block is len(a) - 1. We can come up with quick 
formulas for finding the block number and, given a block number, what digit
it corresponds to:
<pre>
  block num = how many blocks can fit into k? 
            = (k - 1) / (len(a) - 1)!
                ^             ^ size of each block = num inner permutations of a 
       bring back                                  = num permuataions of a after 
      to 0-indexing                                  an element is removed
                                                   = (len(a) - 1)!

  block digit = what index of a[] does block "block num" correspond to?
              = block num % len(a)
</pre>

So the digit we want to add to the outgoing permuation is
<pre>
    a[block digit] = a[block num % len(a)
                   = a[((k - 1) / (len(a) - 1)!) % len(a)]

</pre>
</br></br>
<h4>Some Caveats</h4>

There's one problem we need to watch out for. When there is one element 
left in a we will be dividing by 0 to get the block num. All we need to 
do, then, is stop iteration a little early. When there's only one element 
left in a, add that element straight to the outgoing permuation.
</br> </br>
Note that there's a practical problem with this solution which precludes 
its usefullness on large inputs. In order to compute the next permution 
for a number with $n$ digits, we need to be able to compute $(n-1)!$. This 
isn't a computational problem (we can compute factorials in $O(n)$ time 
with DP). But we might have trouble storing that number: the factorial 
function grows very, very quickly. Even if we had an unsigned 128-bit 
long, the biggest $(n-1)$ we'd be able to handle would be 34.

</br></br>
<h4>Python Implementation</h4>
<pre>
import math


def find_permutation(n, k):
    a = range(1, n+1)
    out = []
    for _ in range(n-1):
        index = ((k-1) / math.factorial(len(a)-1)) % len(a) 
        out.append( a[index ] )
        del a[index]
    out += a
    return out

# let's test it out!
print find_permutation(3, 4)
print find_permutation(3, 6)
print find_permutation(4, 12)
print find_permutation(4, 24)
</pre>
