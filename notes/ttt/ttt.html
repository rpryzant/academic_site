<h2>Random Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

This is a fun little probability riddle I came across. Assume two people take random moves in tic-tac-toe. What's the probability each wins? Or that there's a draw? Let's play with this problem a little.
</br></br>
<h4>Stepping back</h4>

First, consider the more general case where each game is played until no more spots are available on the board. This is the number of ways to select 5 from 9 if order does not matter, because the other player can simply take the spots left over. So the number of possible games is ${9\choose{5}} = 126$.
</br></br>
<h4>Digging in</h4>

Now, let's consider the number of ways each player could win. First, remember that 5 spots must belong to player 1 ($X$) and 4 must belong to player 2 ($O$). We may use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to get these probabilities: we count the number of ways both could win, subtract out the intersection, and divide by the total number of games.

</br></br>
<h4>X's</h4>
Note that the most rows $X$ can fill out is two.
\begin{align}\notag
\#\textrm{ways $X$ can win}  &=  (\#\textrm{ways $X$ has 1 diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row})
 \\\notag&= (\#\textrm{ways $X$ can have 2 diagonal, horizontal, or vertical rows})\\\notag
\#\textrm{ways $X$ can win} &= (\#\textrm{ways $X$ has 1 diagonal, horizontal, or vertical})
 \\\notag &=(\#\textrm{ways $X$ has 1 diagonal AND 1 horizontal or vertical}) 
\\\notag&= (\#\textrm{ways $X$ has 1 horizontal AND 1 vertical}) 
\notag\\&= (\#\textrm{ways $X$ has both diagonal rows})\notag
v\end{align}

Lets tackle each of these terms one at a time.

<ul>
<li> $\#$ ways $X$ has 1 diagonal, horizontal, or vertical. There are 3 horizontal rows, 3 vertical rows, and 2 diagonal rows. Once a row is filled, there are 2 more X's to distribute in the remaining 6 positions. Thus, for each row, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ boards. So this term is
$$8 \cdot \binom{6}{2} = 120$$
<li>$\#$ ways $X$ has 1 diagonal AND 1 horizontal or vertical. There are 2 diagonal rows and 6 horizontal \& vertical rows. Once a diagonal and non-diagonal row have been selected, there are no more X's to distribute in the remaining 4 spots. So this term is
$$ 2 \cdot 6 \cdot \binom{4}{0} = 12 $$
<li> $\#$ ways $X$ has 1 horizontal AND 1 vertical. There are 3 horizontal rows and 3 vertical rows. Once two of these have been selected, there are no more X's to place on the remaining 4 spots. So this term is
$$3 \cdot 3 \cdot \binom{4}{0} = 9$$
<li> $\#$ ways $X$ has both diagonal rows. There is 1 way to select both diagonals. Once both diagonals have been selected, there aren't any more $X$'s to distribute. So this term is
$$1 \cdot \binom{4}{0} = 1$$
</ul>

Bringing everything together, we get the number of ways $X$ could win is
$120 - 12 - 9  - 1=  98$$
</br></br>
<h4>O's</h4>
Now on to player 2 (the O's)! Note that Only one row can be filled, since there are only 4 O's on the board. Since there are 8 possible rows and 1 extra O to place on the remaining 6 spots, this number is 
$$8 \cdot \binom{6}{1} = 48$$

We know that there are 126 games, but there are a total of 98 +48 = 146 ways the X's and O's can have a winning row. So how many of these games result in both players getting a row? How many result in neither player? How many result in exclusive rows?

<ul>
<li> X and O getting a row. Since both player has to get a row, we must exclude diagonals from consideration. Thus, there are 6 possible rows for X. Once X has selected a row, O is left with two rows to choose from. Once X and O have selected rows, there are two remaining X's to place in the three remaining spots. So this term is
$$6 \cdot 2 \cdot \binom{3}{2} = 36$$

<li> $X$ only. This is just the number of times X gets a row minus the number of times X and O get a row. So this term is 98 - 36 = 62.
<li> O only. By the same thinking as above, this is 48 - 36 = 12.
<li> Neither gets a row. This is the total number of games minus everything we have so far. So this term is 126 - 62 - 12 = 52.
</ul>
</br></br>
<h4>Putting everything together</h4>

We now have all the pieces we need to talk about probabilities. Finally! All we need to do is normalize each of the numbers above by the total number of possible games.

\begin{align}
p(X\ \mathrm{only\ wins}) &= \frac{62}{126} = 0.49 \\
p(O\ \mathrm{only\ wins}) &= \frac{12}{126} = 0.095 \\
p(\mathrm{tie}) &= \frac{52}{126} = 0.41 \\
 \end{align}
</br></br>
<h4>Simulation</h4>

These probabilities look pretty weird. Why is there such a large discrepancy between player 1 and 2 winning? Let's simulate a millionrandom games and see whether I was right:

<pre>
from random import choice
from sys import argv

# helper function to quickly generate a game's worth of coordinates
def initAvailable():
    return [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)]

# make a move for a player, given the available board spots
def makeMove(player, board, available):
    # if there aren't any available spots, no move is possible
    if available == []: return None
    # randomly choose a spot, move there, and return its coordinates
    coord = choice(available)
    available.remove(coord)
    board[coord] = player
    return coord

# check to see if the last move was a win, given the current board
def checkWin(move, board):
    # if no move was possible, it's a tie!
    if not move: return "T"
    # otherwise check forward & reverse diagonals, horizontal & vertical lines
    x,y = move
    if   x == y and board.get((0,0)) == board.get((1,1)) == board.get((2,2)) or \
       x+y == 2 and board.get((0,2)) == board.get((1,1)) == board.get((2,0)) or \
                    board.get((0,y)) == board.get((1,y)) == board.get((2,y)) or \
                    board.get((x,0)) == board.get((x,1)) == board.get((x,2)):
        return board.get(move)
    # otherwise nobody's one yet so return nothing
    return None

# play a game!
def playGame(A, B, available):
    board = {}
    move = makeMove(A, board, available)
    while not checkWin(move, board):
        move = makeMove(B, board, available)
        if checkWin(move, board): 
            break
        move = makeMove(A, board, available)
    # return the last made move. if there is no such move, return T for 'tie'
    return board.get(move, 'T') 

# player A is X's, player B is O's
A,B = 'X','O'
g = {A: 0, B: 0, 'T': 0}
n = int(argv[1])
# play n rounds of the game
for _ in range(n):    
    g[playGame(A, B,initAvailable())] += 1
# report results
for type in g:
    print "%s happened %s%% of the time.\n" % (type, round(g[type]/float(n), 4))

</pre>
<pre>
$ time python tictactoe.py 1000000
X happened 0.5848% of the time.
T happened 0.127% of the time.
O happened 0.2883% of the time.

Nope...I got it wrong. Must have made missed some cases. Reader! If you see any mistakes, lemme know!
